Hello!
I'm Ross, currently living and working in Tokyo, Japan.

I have a MMath degree in Mathematics and a DPhil (PhD) in Computational Biology from the University of Oxford, UK.
These days I do data analysis and machine learning in Python.

I used to be [reasonably good](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/su-doku-national-championships-2007-n0sk259kc8b) at sudoku, but nowadays I prefer cryptic crosswords.
